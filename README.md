This repository contains my notes for the Algebraic Geometry I lecture series in the University of Bonn, taught by Daniel Huybrechts. Note that there may be bits in Catalan and Spanish (specially at the beginning). You will find an index called "Algebraic Geometry I.md".

The formatting follows Obsidian's syntax. This is why the latex (and some other things) may look bad in github. I recommend making a local copy of the repository and then opening it in Obsidian. The Obsidian plugin _TikZJax_ may be required for rendering some diagrams.

I very much appreciate any corrections (the notes haven't been proofread by anyone, so use at your own risk!) and suggestions, specially those including lots of examples.
