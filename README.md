This repository contains my notes for the Algebraic Geometry I lecture series in the University of Bonn, taught by Daniel Huybrechts. Note that there may be bits in Catalan and Spanish.

The formatting follows Obsidian's syntax. This is why the latex (and some other things) may look bad in github. I recommend making a local copy of the repository and then opening it in Obsidian.

I very much appreciate any corrections (the notes haven't been proofread by anyone, so use at your own risk!) and suggestions, specially those including lots of examples.
