# Definici√≥

A **Weil divisor** in $X$ is a formal finite linear combination of prime divisors with integer coefficients.

These form an abelian group, denoted $Div(X)$. Usually this is too big to be useful.

## Principal Weil divisor

v. [[Principal Weil divisor]]

## Sheaf associated to a Weil divisor

Let $D \in Div(X)$ be a Weil divisor. Then one can consider the sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules$$\mathcal{O}(D)(U) := \{ f \in K(X)^\times \mid (f)|_U - D|_U \geq 0 \} \cup \{0\},$$where $(f)$ is the principal Weil divisor associated to $f$ (v. [[Principal Weil divisor]]). The expression $(f)|_U-D|_U\geq 0$ means that all the coefficients of $(f)|_U-D|_U$ are non-negative.

This defines a closed subscheme $V(D) \subseteq X$.

# Exemples

## Projective line over algebraically closed field

$X = \mathbb{P}^1_k$ with $k$ alg closed field. The prime divisors are exactly the closed points, which are in bijection with the classical projective points $\{[a_0:a_1]\}$. Hence,$$Div(\mathbb{P}^1_k) = Free(\{[a_0:a_1]\}).$$

## Curve

Let $X = V_+(f) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2_k$ with $k$ algebraically closed, $f \in k[X_0,X_1,X_2]_d$. Then prime divisors are in bijection with points$$\{[a_0:a_1:a_2] \mid f(a_0,a_1,a_2) = 0\}.$$
## Affine line

In the affine line $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, we have$$Div(\mathbb{A}^1_k) = k\langle k\rangle,$$i.e. the $k$-vector space generated by $k$ as a set.

Consider the Weil divisor $D = 2\cdot [0] - 1\cdot[1]$. We give an explicit description of $\mathcal{O}(D)$. Recall that $K(\mathbb{A}^1_k) = k(X)$, and the elements here can be written as $\lambda\prod_{x \in k} (X-x)^{r(x)}$, with $r(x)=0$ except from a finite number, $r(x) \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $\lambda \in k$. Then:
- If $(X-0),\ (X-1) \in U$, then $\mathcal{O}(D)(U)$ contains those elements of $K(X)$ such that $r(0) \geq 2$ and $r(1) \geq -1$, i.e. we allow to have a pole of order at most 1 at $x=1$, and we impose the existence of a zero of multiplicity at least $2$ at $x=0$.
- etc.
