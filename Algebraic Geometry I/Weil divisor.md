A **Weil divisor** in $X$ is a formal finite linear combination of prime divisors with integer coefficients.

These form an abelian group, denoted $Div(X)$. Usually this is too big to be useful.

# Exemples

## Projective line over algebraically closed field

$X = \mathbb{P}^1_k$ with $k$ alg closed field. The prime divisors are exactly the closed points, which are in bijection with the classical projective points $\{[a_0:a_1]\}$. Hence,$$Div(\mathbb{P}^1_k) = Free(\{[a_0:a_1]\}).$$

## Curve

Let $X = V_+(f) \subseteq \mathbb{P}^2_k$ with $k$ algebraically closed, $f \in k[X_0,X_1,X_2]_d$. Then prime divisors are in bijection with points$$\{[a_0:a_1:a_2] \mid f(a_0,a_1,a_2) = 0\}.$$
