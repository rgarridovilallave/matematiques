Let $X$ be a topological space. Define:
- The **dimension** of $X$ to be the maximal length ($n$) of a chain $\emptyset \neq X_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq X_n$ with each $X_i$ closed and irreducible.
- The **codimension** of a closed irreducible subset $Z \subseteq X$ to be the maximal length ($n$) of a chain $Z = Z_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq Z_n$ with each $Z_i$ closed and irreducible.
