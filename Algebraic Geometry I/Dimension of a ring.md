Let $A$ be a ring. Define:
- The **dimension** of $X$ to be the maximal length ($n$) of a chain $\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n$ of prime ideals.
- The **height** of a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq A$ to be the maximal length ($n$) of a chain $\mathfrak{p}_0 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_n = \mathfrak{p}$ of prime ideals.

# Propietats

## Height one prime ideals

If $A$ is Noetherian, $a \in A$ is neither a unit nor a zero divisor, and $\mathfrak{p}$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $a$, then $ht(\mathfrak{p}) = 1$.

## Relation between the dimension and the height

If $A$ is an integral finite type $k$-algebra, then$$ht(\mathfrak{p}) + dim(A/\mathfrak{p}) = dim(A)$$for every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq A$.
