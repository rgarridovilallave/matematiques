## Closed immersion?

If $g$ is separated, then $\Gamma_f$ is a closed immersion.

*Proof.*

Apply the [[Magic square]] to $(f, id_y, g)$. Use that $\Delta_g$ is a closed immersion, and that closed immersions are stable under base change. $\Gamma_f$ is now the composite of an isomorphism followed by a closed immersion. **qed**
