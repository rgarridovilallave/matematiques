A morphism of schemes $f: X \to Y$ is said to be **separated** if the diagonal morphism $\Delta: X \to X \times_Y X$ given by $(id_X,id_X)$  (v. [[Fibre product]]) is a **closed immersion** (v. [[Subschemes]], [[Morphisms of schemes]]). An $S$-scheme $X$ is separated if the diagonal $\Delta_{X/S}$ is a closed immersion.

# Exemples

## Affine schemes

$f: Spec(B) \to Spec(A)$ is always separated.

## Affine line

The affine line is separated.

## Affine line with double origin

No separated. The image of $(\mathbb{A}^1_k)_{00} \to (\mathbb{A}^1_k)_{00} \times_k (\mathbb{A}^1_k)_{00}$ can't be closed.
